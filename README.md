# Overview:

A volunteer organization in New York City called *Rising Teens* wants to predict whether students in select school districts will pass or fail their respective course, and offer tutoring assistance to those who may be in need. 

# Business Understanding

*Rising Teens* plans to work with struggling school districts in the area to provide tutoring for high school children they believe need additional support to pass their classes, however tutors are limited, and the organization is unsure how to predict which students will need support the most.

Our suggestion is to use a supervised learning approach to predict students that are at risk to fail their courses, specifically with classification models. 

# Data Understanding

Portugal has obtained [data](https://www.kaggle.com/impapan/student-performance-data-set) on demographic and social characteristics of students in multiple high schools in the area, along with their final course grade. By training our model on this data, we can predict which students are likely to fail their courses based on the attributes given. Lastly, school districts can distribute surveys to collect this data at the beginning of the school year, and we can predict whether each student should be assigned a tutor based on their pass/fail classification. A pass grade is defined as a 60% (D) or higher for these districts.

As more data is gathered, our model can improve further and potentially be used at a national level to provide schools with the ability to help students in need of support.
